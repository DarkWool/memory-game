# Memory Game - [view live](https://darkwool.github.io/memory-game/)

With this project I decided to use _**Vite**_ as I noticed that _create-react-app_ was getting obsolete (perhaps a long time ago) and I have to say that it was a good choice.

As one of my very first projects with React I started to have a better organization with my components with a clearer (but not perfect!) understanding of their power, aside from that I had the "time" to learn about `portals`, `useMemo` and `useLayoutEffect` hooks. (Also learned a little bit about `contexts` which I hope to implement in my next project!)

## Specifications

1. Take a little bit of time to think about how you want to implement your application, the features you want to implement, which components you need, and how to structure your application. Your application should include a scoreboard, which counts the current score, and a “Best Score”, which shows the best score you achieved thus far. You also need a couple of cards that display images and possibly informational text. There should be a function that displays the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one. Be sure to invoke that function when the component mounts.
1. Now that you’ve thought about the structure of your application, set up the folder structure and start creating the components. We suggest you use functional components and therefore hooks in this project.
1. Style your application so you can show it off!
